1)	to start new project with use "git init"
	for cloning existing project for contributions use "git clone"
2)	then "git status" to know status of runnig running or ran in that specific folder

Creating Versions of desired project

1) add file to git using "git add {filename}"
   git expect this file to be committed next by user
	"git add --all" or "git add ." is used to add all files to cache directory for commit.

2) commit first file add by using "git commit -m "message used    to identify the version""
	eg : git commit -m "Initial phase"

	after completion of each major step create a version with specific message, for easy rollback.
	Only those files version that are add to git  is committed  as new version, others are avoided
	Each version produced with each commit has an id consisting of 40 letter checksum. It is made by combining which user made that change, at which time &  date, using which mail id, also details for previous commits.The commit id doesn't repeat.
	head entity represents current committed version on which we are working, versus Mater represents last commit
3) By using "git log" we can view all activities performed on a file
4) By using commit id shown in result of above aommand we can rollback to desired version 
	command: git checkout "commit_id"
	now we can do desired changes......ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
	
	After performing this step "git log" will show only one commit along with id.
	 For showing full log:
		git log --all
